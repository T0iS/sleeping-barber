Project focused on implementing one of the standard IPC problems - the sleeping barber problem. 

It shows the main purpose of semaphores and data-exchange between processes mainly using pipes and shared memory.

The implementation is created for both processes and threads.
I used mainly posix library tools since I figured out to like these more than the System V ones. Also, I was pretty used to these.
